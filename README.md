# TikTone
A musical memory game. [Hosted live](https://maxlams.github.io/tiktone/) from this repository. Inspired by *[Simon]*. No, not inspired by TikTok.

## Instructions:
**From the site:** 
*Press start to begin! A random note will play and you'll have to play the exact same thing. If you're correct, you'll be taken to the next level, where another note plays. Now, you'll have to remember everything you played before, and the random note that just played... for each level!*

## Made with:
- **[Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/)** (4.4.1) - A front-end framework used for responsiveness. Resize the screen and see what happens.
- **[jQuery](https://jquery.com/)** (3.4.1)
